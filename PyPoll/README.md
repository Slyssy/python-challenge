Below are the instructions for this assignment.

This was one of the hardest homework assignments I've ever done.
I learned a lot from working to figure this stuff out, and I spent quite a bit of time on Google and reviewing class videos in order to figure it out. Even though I learned a lot by doing this exercise, I still fill like I am standing on shakey legs. I still need a lot more practice, but I am excited to take the next steps.

Perhaps the coolest thing about this exercise was the pure joy I received when I ran the code, and I didn't get an error. I was literally nervous every time I pressed enter after inputting "python main.py".

* In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

* You will be give a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

  ```text

  -------------------------
  Total Votes: 3521001
  -------------------------
  Khan: 63.000% (2218231)
  Correy: 20.000% (704200)
  Li: 14.000% (492940)
  O'Tooley: 3.000% (105630)
