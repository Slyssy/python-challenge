Below are the instructions for this assignment.

This was one of the hardest homework assignments I've ever done.
I learned a lot from working to figure this stuff out, and I spent quite a bit of time on Google and reviewing class videos in order to figure it out. Even though I learned a lot by doing this exercise, I still fill like I am standing on shakey legs. I still need a lot more practice, but I am excited to take the next steps.

Perhaps the coolest thing about this exercise was the pure joy I received when I ran the code, and I didn't get an error. I was literally nervous every time I pressed enter after inputting "python main.py".

* In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

* Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```

* In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
